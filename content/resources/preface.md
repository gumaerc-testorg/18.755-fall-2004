description: This document contains a summary of the lecture material. These lecture
  notes were created using material from Prof. Helgason's books Differential Geometry,
  Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces and Groups and Geometric Analysis, intermixed with
  new content created for the class. The notes are self-contained except for some
  details about topological groups for which we refer to Chevalley's Theory of Lie
  Groups I and Pontryagin's Topological Groups. Documenting the material from the
  course, the text has a fairly large bibliography up to 1978. Since then, a huge
  number of books on Lie groups has appeared.
